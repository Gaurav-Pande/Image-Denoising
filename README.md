# Image-Denoising

### Background
Image noise is a random change in a pixel hue or saturation value of a pixel in an image. There can be multiple sources of image noise. Noise can get introduced inherently at different stage of image capture pipeline from light variation, camera optics, image sensor to image storage.

### The Problem
One of the fundamental challenge in the field of Image processing and Computer vision is Image denoising where the goal is to estimate the original image by suppressing noise from the contaminated region in an Image. This has numerous applications such as:
* digitisation and restoration of old/physical documents.

* satellite images, etc
The aim of this project is to extract a clean image Ix from the noisy image Iy, with noisy component as In, which is explained by Iy=Ix+In.
